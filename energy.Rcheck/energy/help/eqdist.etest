_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The k-sample multivariate E-test of equal distributions is
     performed. The statistic is computed from the original pooled
     samples, stacked in matrix 'x' where each row is a multivariate
     observation, or the corresponding distance matrix. The first
     'sizes[1]' rows of 'x' are the first sample, the next 'sizes[2]'
     rows of 'x' are the second sample, etc.

     The test is implemented by nonparametric bootstrap, an approximate
      permutation test with 'R' replicates. For large samples it is
     more efficient if 'x' contains the data matrix rather than the
     distances. Incomplete statistics are supported for the two-sample
     test. If 'incomplete==TRUE', at most 'N' observations from each
     sample  (by sampling without replacement) are used in the
     calculation of the statistic. If 'distance==TRUE' complete
     statistics are always computed.

     The definition of the multisample E-statistic is given in the 
     'ksample.e' documentation.
