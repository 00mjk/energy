_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The k-sample multivariate E-test of equal distributions is
     performed. The statistic is computed from the original pooled
     samples, stacked in matrix 'x' where each row is a multivariate
     observation, or the corresponding distance matrix. The first
     'sizes[1]' rows of 'x' are the first sample, the next 'sizes[2]'
     rows of 'x' are the second sample, etc.

     The test is implemented by nonparametric bootstrap, an approximate
      permutation test with 'R' replicates.

     The definition of the multisample E-statistic is given in the 
     'ksample.e' documentation.

     If 'incomplete==TRUE', incomplete E-statistics (which are
     incomplete V-statistics) are computed. That is, at most 'N'
     observations from each sample are used, by sampling without
     replacement  as needed.
