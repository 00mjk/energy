_E-_d_i_s_t_a_n_c_e

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Returns the E-distances (energy statistics) between clusters.

_U_s_a_g_e:

      edist(x, sizes, distance=FALSE, ix = 1:sum(sizes))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: data matrix of pooled sample or Euclidean distances

   sizes: vector of sample sizes

distance: logical: if TRUE, x is a distance matrix

      ix: a permutation of the row indices of x 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     A vector containing the pairwise two-sample multivariate 
     E-statistics for comparing clusters or samples is returned.  The
     e-distance between clusters is computed from the original pooled
     data,  stacked in matrix 'x' where each row is a multivariate
     observation, or  from the distance matrix 'x' of the original
     data, or distance object  returned by 'dist'. The first 'sizes[1]'
     rows of the original data  matrix are the first sample, the next
     'sizes[2]' rows are the second  sample, etc. The permutation
     vector 'ix' may be used to obtain e-distances corresponding to a
     clustering solution at a given level in the hierarchy.

     The e-distance between two clusters C_i, C_j of size n_i, n_j 
     proposed by Szekely and Rizzo (2003ab) is the e-distance
     e(C_i,C_j), defined by

       e(S_i, S_j) = (n_i n_j)(n_i+n_j)[2M_(ij)-M_(ii)-M_(jj)],

     where

     M_{ij} = 1/(n_i n_j) sum[1:n_i, 1:n_j] ||X_(ip) - X_(jq)||,

     || || denotes Euclidean norm, and X_(ip) denotes the p-th
     observation in the i-th cluster.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A object of class 'dist' containing the lower triangle of the
     e-distance matrix of cluster distances corresponding to the
     permutation  of indices 'ix' is returned.
